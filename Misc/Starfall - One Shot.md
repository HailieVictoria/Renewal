9 people pulled a god from the heavens to speak to him
- they don't associate with each other anymore
- they don't know how to undo it

return to starfall
- not habitable by people yet
- as stepping on, gets an uneasy sense of arcane fallout
- something feels like its draining and remedying prior

if we fall, we will end up as statues

stars say that centuries from now, people will find their way here and have the
ability to speak to us as statues
