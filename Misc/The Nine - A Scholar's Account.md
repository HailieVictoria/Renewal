"I was but a child when the Nine changed everything. The night sky itself seemed to crack, and from those fractures came beings who would reshape our world. They were not born gods, mind you. They were mortals once, like you and me, until ambition and desperation drove them to attempt something no mortal should dare."


"The Architects of Our Age Six 
centuries have passed since the Sundering, yet the Nine remain the pillars upon which our world rests. They are the reason magic still flows through mortal hands, the reason we can heal our wounded and light our darkness. But each carries their divine burden differently, and their goals... their goals are as varied as the stars they once pulled from the heavens."

[[User]], The Grand Architect 
"He builds bridges where none existed before, connects minds and hearts across impossible distances. I've heard his followers speak of unity—not through force, but through understanding. Yet some whisper that his vision of connection might bind us all too closely together." 

[[Lyra]], The Voice Eternal 
"Her songs can end wars before they begin, bring peace to the most troubled souls. The lands under her influence know harmony like nowhere else. But I've met those who've heard her true voice, and they speak in perfect unison now—as if they share but one thought between them." 

[[Mars]], The Twilight Vessel 
"He stands at the threshold between what was and what might be, carrying the weight of divine connection like a beacon in the dark. His followers believe he prepares for something greater, though whether salvation or sacrifice, none can say." 

[[Vesper]], The Wandering Shell and [[Amakys]], The Wild Mirror 
"Two who became one, or perhaps one who became two—I've never been certain. They walk the boundaries between civilization and wilderness, speaking in riddles about patterns and cycles. They offer wisdom to those who seek it, but never push their counsel upon others." 

[[Siege]], The Just Crown 
"A ruler who earned his throne through deed rather than birthright. His kingdom prospers under laws that protect both strong and weak alike. Yet I wonder sometimes if his justice is too rigid, if order imposed too firmly might strangle the very freedom it seeks to protect." 

[[Argon]], The First Dragon "They say he rules from isolation, commanding vast territories through agents and whispers. Some call him tyrant, others protector. I suspect the truth is that he knows something the rest of us don't—something terrible enough to justify his watchful distance." 

[[Fade]], The Collector 
"She walks between worlds, gathering fragments of what was lost in the Sundering. Her followers speak of restoration, of healing the wounds torn in reality itself. But I've seen what she collects, and I fear what manner of power she seeks to restore." 

[[Pendyll Quil]] Quill, The Mortal Maker 
"The scholar among them, the one who closed the academies 'for our own protection.' His research continues in secret, and those who've glimpsed his work speak of artificial minds and consciousness given form. He shapes thought itself as easily as clay."
