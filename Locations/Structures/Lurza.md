## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Dying River Fortress

- Built along what was once a mighty river cutting through the harsh Red Desert, Lurza now stands as a slowly dying fortress watching over an increasingly barren waterway. The settlement was originally founded to protect something of great importance, though the desert's harsh conditions have claimed most records and residents who might remember what that purpose was. Neighboring towns occasionally wonder if they'll witness an exodus of any remaining inhabitants seeking refuge from the desert's expanding reach. The Red Desert's unforgiving nature makes normal travel impossible, leaving Lurza isolated and mysterious.
