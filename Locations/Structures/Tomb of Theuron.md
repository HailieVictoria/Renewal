## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Scholar's Final Test

- Hidden within the Winger Mountains, this enigmatic tomb appears as a seamless structure of pale, iridescent stone that shifts colors and seems to camouflage itself against its surroundings. Built as the final resting place of the legendary scholar Theuron, who vanished after discovering a mysterious astrolabe, the tomb serves as both monument and trial for those who would follow in his footsteps. Those who successfully navigate its chambers emerge with profound insights and strange visions.
