## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Storm Giant's Solitude

- The entire island known as Lonely Is. serves as home to a single inhabitant: [[Ognarod]], a storm giant who has claimed the land as his personal domain and given it both its name and its character. Despite his fair temperament when visitors do manage to reach him, the journey to his cave requires navigating the persistent storm that constantly ebbs and flows around the island, creating a natural barrier that few can overcome.
