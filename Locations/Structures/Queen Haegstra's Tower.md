## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Island of Forgotten Names

- Known only through the cryptic words of the Peridot dragon Draphilir, this mysterious tower stands on an island in the treacherous Blyss region where the very name belies the deadly nature of the journey required to reach it. Draphilir speaks of countless statues scattered across the island, each bearing names that the world itself seems to have forgotten or actively suppressed from memory. The dragon's reluctance to elaborate on what lies within the tower only adds to its mystique, suggesting secrets so profound or terrible that even a creature of Draphilir's power approaches the subject with caution.
