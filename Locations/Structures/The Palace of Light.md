## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Beacon of the Radiant Eternal 

- Rising from the landscape as a single, massive structure rather than a traditional city, the Palace of Light serves as the primary stronghold for priests and holy warriors devoted to the Radiant Eternal. This architectural marvel houses training halls, meditation chambers, and healing sanctuaries all within its gleaming walls, attracting pilgrims and faithful from across the continent. The structure itself seems to emit a subtle luminescence that can be seen from miles away, serving as both literal and spiritual beacon.
