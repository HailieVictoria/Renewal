## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Silk Roads' Heart 

- This strategic forest-coast trade hub has grown prosperous by specializing in Prairie Silk processing and serving as a crucial exchange point between the plains and coastal peoples. The town's distinctive architecture blends forest and plains styles, with elevated wooden walkways connecting buildings above flood-prone areas while silk banners mark the various trade guilds. Cultural fusion thrives here in both cuisine and customs, as merchants from different regions converge at the twice-weekly grand markets held in the expansive market square.
