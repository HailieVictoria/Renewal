## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Compass Grove

- This elven city-state exemplifies harmony between civilization and nature, with structures seamlessly integrated around living trees and natural formations rather than replacing them. At the heart of the settlement grows an ancient grand tree housing a massive 30-foot compass that predates the city itself, its needle mysteriously pointing not north but toward the greatest conflict currently unfolding anywhere in the world. The elven inhabitants have built their society around this mystical indicator, using its guidance to understand when and where their intervention might be needed.
