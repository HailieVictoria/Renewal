## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Wary Trading Post

- Positioned further along the Evioli trail, Gnotobi benefits greatly from the trade flowing from Keshwindi while maintaining a cautious distance from its sister city's darker reputation. Citizens here whisper nervously about the arena's influence and view travelers from Keshwindi with deep suspicion, often crossing streets to avoid them entirely. At the town's heart stands an ancient shrine, so weathered by time that its original purpose has been forgotten, reduced to little more than curious stonework that locals treat with respectful indifference.
