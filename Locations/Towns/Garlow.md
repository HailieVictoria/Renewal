## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Scholar's Marsh 

- Rising from transformed swampland on raised platforms and walkways, Garlow represents a triumph of magical terraforming over harsh environment, governed by a council of senior scholars who have used their knowledge to create self-sufficient agriculture. The city's living architecture adapts to environmental needs while its reputation as a center of magical research and education draws students from across the continent.
