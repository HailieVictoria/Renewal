## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Contested Woods

- This recently established settlement has emerged as a significant force within the Belanora forests south of Thorum, though its growth has come at the cost of escalating tensions with local inhabitants. A bitter political struggle over land rights has developed between the human settlers of Locquine and the Suki Elves who have long called these southern forests home. The conflict has created an atmosphere of distrust and occasional violence, with both sides claiming ancestral rights to the rich woodland territory.
