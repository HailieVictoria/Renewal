## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Quiet Harbor 

- This modest port town has carved out a comfortable existence through rice cultivation, fish processing, and emerging Prairie Silk textile work, all centered around its protected natural harbor. The combination of extensive rice paddies, strategic location along trade routes, and growing reputation for specialty fabrics has created steady prosperity for its 120-150 inhabitants. Harbor Master Kenzo maintains efficient port operations while the town's mixed population works together to build their community's future.
