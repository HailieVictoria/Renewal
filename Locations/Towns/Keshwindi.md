## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Arena of No Return

- Nestled where two rivers converge in the sandy Hills of Dolor, Keshwindi presents a lush oasis city built around the infamous Crimson Colosseum, its grand arena that dominates the skyline. The intersection of waterways creates fertile ground for thriving markets and trade exports, making it a natural stopping point for western travelers. However, visitors often find themselves mysteriously compelled to participate in the arena's deadly spectacles, with many who enter the city unable to leave without first facing whatever challenges await within the Colosseum's bloodstained sands.
