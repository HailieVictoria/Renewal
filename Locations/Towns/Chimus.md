## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Artifice Harbor

- Sprawling along the coastline where the Tonyfall River meets the Gulf of Chimea, Chimus has recently become a site of intense archaeological interest following the discovery of a massive artifact bed beneath the river. Nearly twenty objects of mysterious origin and power have been recovered so far, suggesting a long-forgotten battle of significant magnitude once took place here. The city's proximity to the leyline of light has made it a frequent stopping point for pilgrims traveling to and from the Palace of Light.
