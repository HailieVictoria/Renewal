## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Empty Echo 

- Standing perfectly preserved on Estri Is., the town of Hume Une presents one of Ve's most unsettling mysteries: a complete settlement with houses, church, mill, and all the infrastructure of a thriving community, yet utterly devoid of any inhabitants. The buildings show no signs of violence, disaster, or decay that might explain the absence of residents, and no records exist of where the population might have gone. Like an echo of the ancient Roanoke mystery, Hume Une continues to intrigue and disturb visitors who find perfectly set tables, unfinished projects, and personal belongings suggesting the residents simply vanished mid-activity.
