## General Notes
- Referred to as: The Anvil of the North

- Carved directly into the mountainside like steps for giants, Dorlev is a cascading marvel of dwarven engineering renowned throughout the realm for its metalworking and scholarly pursuits. The city serves as both a major trading hub and center of learning, with the constant rhythm of hammers echoing through the valley from countless forges while the Runekeep Academy preserves traditional dwarven magic and crafting techniques. The Steadfast Vault operates as the most secure bank in the region.
