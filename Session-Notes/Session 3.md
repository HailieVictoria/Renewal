**When fallen star meets withered ground,  
And blight spreads swift where none is found,  
Look not to sky for heaven's rage--”  
The curator turns another page.** 

Three spheres of light that should not be,  
Placed by hands that none can see,  
Triangle drawn on mortal plane  
To bring the Light from heaven's reign. 

The scholar's puppet thinks he leads,  
While artifact collector feeds  
Upon the crisis he creates--”  
The palace bright, it contemplates. 

What seems as star from distant void  
Is tool by collector employed,  
To pull from earth what should remain  
And cast to astral sea's domain. 

The swamp grows dark, the earth decays,  
As archive keeper counts the days,  
Until the light no longer shields  
And cosmic balance claim their yields.

When student seekers find this rhyme,  
Know well: you race against the time,  
For he who gathers without end  
Makes enemy of former friend. 

Seek the palace made of light,  
Before it fades to endless night,  
The curator's greatest prize to claim--”  
But beware the scholar's ancient game.
